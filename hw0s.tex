% All you need to do is fill in your name, UMN ID, email address,
% and the number of the pset. (Search for "METADATA" to find the place
% for this.) Then, you can go straight to the "EXERCISE 1"

%	VARIOUS USEFUL COMMANDS
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% The commands below might be convenient. For example, you probably
% prefer to write $\powset[2]{V}$ for the set of $2$-element subsets
% of $V$, rather than writing $\mathcal{P}_2(V)$.
% Notice that you can easily define your own commands like this.
% Caveat: Some of these commands need to be properly "guarded" when
% they occur in subscripts or superscripts. So you should not write
% $K_\CC$, but rather $K_{\CC}$.
\newcommand{\CC}{\mathbb{C}} % complex numbers
\newcommand{\RR}{\mathbb{R}} % real numbers
\newcommand{\QQ}{\mathbb{Q}} % rational numbers
\newcommand{\NN}{\mathbb{N}} % nonnegative integers
\newcommand{\PP}{\mathbb{P}} % positive integers
\newcommand{\Z}[1]{\mathbb{Z}/#1\mathbb{Z}} % integers modulo k
                                            % (syntax: "\Z{k}")
\newcommand{\ZZ}{\mathbb{Z}} % integers
\newcommand{\id}{\operatorname{id}} % identity map
\newcommand{\lcm}{\operatorname{lcm}}
% Lowest common multiple. For historical reasons, LaTeX has a \gcd
% command built in, but not an \lcm command. The preceding line
% rectifies that.
\newcommand{\set}[1]{\left\{ #1 \right\}}
% $\set{...}$ compiles to {...} (set-brackets).
\newcommand{\abs}[1]{\left| #1 \right|}
% $\abs{...}$ compiles to |...| (absolute value, or size of a set).
\newcommand{\tup}[1]{\left( #1 \right)}
% $\tup{...}$ compiles to (...) (parentheses, or tuple-brackets).
\newcommand{\ive}[1]{\left[ #1 \right]}
% $\ive{...}$ compiles to [...] (Iverson bracket, aka truth value; also, set of first n integers).
\newcommand{\floor}[1]{\left\lfloor #1 \right\rfloor}
% $\floor{...}$ compiles to |_..._| (floor function).
\newcommand{\underbrack}[2]{\underbrace{#1}_{\substack{#2}}}
% $\underbrack{...1}{...2}$ yields
% $\underbrace{...1}_{\substack{...2}}$. This is useful for doing
% local rewriting transformations on mathematical expressions with
% justifications. For example, try this out:
% $ \underbrack{(a+b)^2}{= a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \\ \text{(by the binomial formula)}} $
\newcommand{\powset}[2][]{\ifthenelse{\equal{#2}{}}{\mathcal{P}\left(#1\right)}{\mathcal{P}_{#1}\left(#2\right)}}
% $\powset[k]{S}$ stands for the set of all $k$-element subsets of
% $S$. The argument $k$ is optional, and if not provided, the result
% is the whole powerset of $S$.

\section{Exercise 1: Geometric series and a bit more}

\subsection{Problem}

Let $a \in \QQ$ and $b \in \QQ$.
        % "\QQ" is an abbreviation for "\mathbb{Q}", and stands for the rational numbers.
Prove that the equalities
\begin{align}
& \tup{a-b} \tup{ a^{n-1} + a^{n-2} b + a^{n-3} b^2 + \cdots + a b^{n-2} + b^{n-1} }
        % The "\tup{...}" command puts the "..." in parentheses.
        % The "\cdots" is the "right" way to get a vertically centered
        % ellipsis (I don't mind if you just write "...", but "\cdots" is
        % considered more professional).
\nonumber \\
        % An "\\" means "new line". So this is how you actually get a
        % linebreak if you want one. You can do this in text, too, not just
        % in align environments. See below for what "\nonumber" means.
& = a^n - b^n
\label{eq.exe.geo-series.1}
\end{align}
        % Several things are happening here.
        % 1. The "\begin{align}" and "\end{align}" commands delimit an "align"
        %    environment, which is a way to write several formulas one under
        %    the other while aligning them at some chosen places (e.g., at
        %    the equality signs if you wish).
        % 2. The "\tup{a-b}" yields "(a-b)" when compiled. You could achieve
        %    the same effect by just writing "(a-b)". The difference is mostly
        %    aesthetical: If you want something bigger than "a-b" inside the
        %    parentheses -- say, a fraction or a summation sign --, then
        %    writing "\tup{...}" will automatically stretch the parentheses to
        %    the size of whatever you put inside them, while "(...)" will
        %    just generate two normal-size parentheses. You don't have toß
        %    follow my stylistic choice.
        % 3. The expression "b^2" means "b to the 2nd power".
        %    The expression "a^{n-2}" means "a to the (n-2)-nd power".
        %    Why did we put {...} braces around the "n-2" but not around the
        %    "2"? It's to tell LaTeX that the "n-2" all belongs in the
        %    exponent, and not just the "n". If you wrote "a^n-2" instead,
        %    only the "n" would end up in the exponent, so you would get
        %    "a to the n-th power, minus 2".
        %    Of course, when the exponent is only 1 letter long, no {...}
        %    braces are needed.
        % 4. The "&" symbol means "align the equations here".
        %    The "\label" command lets you give an equation a label by which
        %    you can later refer to it. So this equation is now labelled
        %    "eq.exe.geo-series.1", and you can refer to it using
        %    "\eqref{eq.exe.geo-series.1}". Note that the labels do *not* get
        %    printed in the compiled PDF; they just become "(1)", "(2)" etc.
        % 5. "\nonumer" means that the first line of the "align" environment
        %    gets no label.
and
\begin{align}
& \tup{a-b}^2 \tup{ 1 a^{n-1} + 2 a^{n-2} b + 3 a^{n-3} b^2 + \cdots + \tup{n-1} a b^{n-2} + n b^{n-1} } \nonumber \\
&= a^{n+1} - \tup{n+1} a b^n + n b^{n+1}
\label{eq.exe.geo-series.2}
\end{align}
hold for each $n \in \NN$.
        % "\NN" is an abbreviation for "\mathbb{N}", and stands for the nonnegative integers.

(Here and in the following, $\NN$ stands for the set
$\set{0, 1, 2, \ldots}$.
        % The "\set{...}" command puts the "..." in set-braces.
        % The "\ldots" command gives an ellipsis that looks a bit better than what you
        % would get by just writing "...". It's mostly a matter of taste,
        % and I don't mind if you just write "...".
We also recall that empty sums -- i.e., sums that have no
addends at all -- evaluate to $0$ by definition. This applies,
in particular, to the sums
$a^{n-1} + a^{n-2} b + a^{n-3} b^2 + \cdots + a b^{n-2} + b^{n-1}$
and
$1 a^{n-1} + 2 a^{n-2} b + 3 a^{n-3} b^2 + \cdots + \tup{n-1} a b^{n-2} + n b^{n-1}$
in the case when $n = 0$.)
        % LaTeX ignores single linebreaks in the sourcecode (or, rather,
        % treats them just as whitespaces). This is why the linebreak
        % between "have no" and "&=" doesn't cause a linebreak in the
        % PDF.

\subsection{Remark}

A consequence of the formulas
\eqref{eq.exe.geo-series.1} and \eqref{eq.exe.geo-series.2}
is that every rational number $x \neq 1$ satisfies
\begin{align*}
        % The "\begin{align*}" and "\end{align*}" commands do the same
        % as "\begin{align}" and "\end{align}", except that they don't
        % number the equations.
1 + x + x^2 + \cdots + x^{n-1} &= \dfrac{1 - x^n}{1 - x}
        % "\dfrac{a}{b}" gives the "a over b" fraction.
        % Actually, "\frac{a}{b}" does the same thing; you will only
        % see the difference if you use them in text (in which case
        % the "\frac{a}{b}" fraction will be a lot smaller than the
        % "\dfrac{a}{b}" one). Again, it is a matter of taste.
\qquad
        % "\qquad" produces an amount of white space, similar to a
        % "tab" in text editors. I usually put it between different
        % equations on a single line.
\text{and} \\
        % "\text{...}" allows you to write regular (non-italicized) text
        % inside a maths environment. For example, "\text{and}" will
        % make the "and" look like regular text.
1 + 2 x + 3 x^2 + \cdots + n x^{n-1}
&= \dfrac{1 - \tup{n+1} x^n + n x^{n+1}}{\tup{1 - x}^2} .
\end{align*}
Indeed, these equalities follow by setting $a = 1$ and $b = x$
in the equalities
\eqref{eq.exe.geo-series.1} and \eqref{eq.exe.geo-series.2}
and dividing by $1-x$ or $1-x^2$, respectively.

More generally, the formulas
\eqref{eq.exe.geo-series.1} and \eqref{eq.exe.geo-series.2}
remain true when $a$ and $b$ are two commuting elements of an
arbitrary ring
(we will later learn what this means; for now, let us
just say that, e.g., we could let $a$ and $b$ be two commuting
matrices instead of rational numbers).

\subsection{Solution}

We will use the summation sign when we solve this exercise.
This will make our formulas both shorter and clearer.
For example, instead of
``$1 a^{n-1} + 2 a^{n-2} b + 3 a^{n-3} b^2 + \cdots + \tup{n-1} a b^{n-2} + n b^{n-1}$'',
it will let us just write
``$\sum_{k=1}^n k b^{k-1}$''.

Let us give a crash course on the use of the summation sign.
We refer to \cite[Section 1.4]{detnotes}
        % "\cite[...]{...}" is a way to cite other sources
        % (books, papers, anything). The syntax is
        % "\cite[place]{source you are citing}".
        % (The "place" can be a theorem or section or chapter,
        % or you can omit it and just write "\cite{source}".)
        % See the bibliography at the end of this homework for
        % what the "source" part should be.
for details and further information\footnote{and to
\cite[Section 2.14]{detnotes} for proofs of well-definedness
and basic properties}.
        % "\footnote" does what you would expect it to do.
        % Caveat: You can't put a \footnote inside a mathematical
        % expression or formula. (But you shouldn't anyway -- it would
        % look like an exponent.)

\begin{itemize}
        % "\begin{itemize}" gives a bullet list.
        % Use "\item" to place a bullet,
        % and "\end{itemize}" to end the list.

\item Assume that $S$ is a finite set, and that $a_s$ is a
      number (e.g., a real number) for each $s \in S$.
      Thus you have $\abs{S}$ many numbers $a_s$ in total.
      Then, $\sum_{s \in S} a_s$ shall denote the sum of all
      of these $\abs{S}$ many numbers.
      For example,
      \begin{align*}
      \sum_{s \in \set{2, 5, 6}} s^3 = 2^3 + 5^3 + 6^3
      \end{align*}
              % It is perfectly fine to use \begin{align*} and \end{align*}
              % for just a single line (so you are not actually aligning anything).
      (here, $S = \set{2, 5, 6}$ and $a_s = s^3$ for each
      $s \in S$)
      and
      \begin{align*}
      \sum_{s \in \set{5, 7, 9, 11}} \dfrac{1}{s}
       = \dfrac{1}{5} + \dfrac{1}{7} + \dfrac{1}{9} + \dfrac{1}{11}
      \end{align*}
      (here, $S = \set{5, 7, 9, 11}$ and $a_s = \dfrac{1}{s}$
      for each $s \in S$).
      
      The letter $s$ here plays the same role as the
      letter $s$ in ``$\set{s^2 \mid s \in \set{2, 3, 4}}$''
      or in ``the function that sends each integer $s$ to
      $s^2 - 1$''; it designates the ``moving part'' in a
      definition (it is what is called a ``bound variable''
      or a ``running index'').
      You don't have to use the specific letter $s$ for it;
      you can use any other letter instead (as long as it
      does not already have a different meaning) and get the
      same result.
      For example, the sum $\sum_{s \in \set{2, 5, 6}} s^3$
      can be rewritten as
      $\sum_{i \in \set{2, 5, 6}} i^3$ or as
      $\sum_{\mathfrak{G} \in \set{2, 5, 6}} \mathfrak{G}^3$.
        % "\mathfrak{...}" is the Fraktur font, used mostly
        % when running out of other letters and to scare off
        % readers. Most mathematicians go through a phase of
        % writing text with it.
      When the set $S$ is empty (so you have no numbers $a_s$
      at all), the sum $\sum_{s \in S} a_s$ is defined
      to be $0$; this is called an \textit{empty sum}.

\item Assume that $u$ and $v$ are two integers, and that $a_s$
      is a number (e.g., a real number) for each
      $s \in \set{u, u+1, \ldots, v}$.
      (When $u > v$, we understand the set
      $\set{u, u+1, \ldots, v}$ to be empty -- it does not
      contain any ``anti-integers'' either.)
      Then, $\sum_{s = u}^v a_s$ is just a shorthand for
      the sum $\sum_{s \in \set{u, u+1, \ldots, v}} a_s$.
      This sum can also be written as
      $a_u + a_{u+1} + \cdots + a_v$, but this notation
      presumes the reader to guess what the ``general term''
      $a_s$ looks like.
      For example,
      \begin{align*}
      \sum_{s = 5}^{10} s^s
      = 5^5 + 6^6 + 7^7 + 8^8 + 9^9 + 10^{10}
      = 5^5 + 6^6 + \cdots + 10^{10}
      \end{align*}
      (arguably, guessing the general term is easy here,
      but look at the sum in \eqref{eq.exe.geo-series.2}).
      For another example,
      \begin{align*}
      \sum_{s = -2}^{2} s^2
      = \tup{-2}^2 + \tup{-1}^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 .
      \end{align*}

\item Expressions of the form $\sum_{s \in S} a_s$ and
      $\sum_{s \in \set{u, u+1, \ldots, v}} a_s$ are called
      ``finite sums'', and the $\sum$ symbol is called the
      ``summation sign''.

\item Finite sums satisfy the rules that you would expect.
      For example, assume that a finite set $S$ is written
      as a union of two disjoint subsets $A$ and $B$ (so
      each element of $S$ belongs to one of $A$ and $B$,
      but not to both).
      Assume that $a_s$ is a number for each $s \in S$.
      Then,
      \begin{align*}
      \sum_{s \in S} a_s = \sum_{s \in A} a_s + \sum_{s \in B} a_s .
      \end{align*}
      For example, if $S = \set{1, 2, \ldots, 2n}$ for some
      $n \in \NN$, and if
      \begin{align*}
      A &= \set{\text{the even elements of } S} = \set{2, 4, 6, \ldots, 2n}
      \qquad \text{and} \\
      B &= \set{\text{the odd elements of } S} = \set{1, 3, 5, \ldots, 2n-1} ,
      \end{align*}
      then this formula becomes
      \begin{align*}
      a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_{2n}
      = \tup{a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + \cdots + a_{2n}}
        + \tup{a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + \cdots + a_{2n-1}} .
      \end{align*}
      This is exactly what you would expect: To sum the
      $2n$ numbers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n}$, you can first
      split them into the ``even'' and the ``odd'' ones
      (to be pedantic: rather, the ones with the even subscripts
      and the ones with the odd subscripts), and separately
      sum the former and the latter, and subsequently add the
      two small sums together.
      See \cite[Section 1.4.2]{detnotes} for this and several
      other rules (and for their rigorous proofs, if you are
      that skeptical).
      You can use all these rules without saying, except
      for the ``telescoping sums'' rule (which you should
      cite by name when you apply it).
      For lots of practice with sums, see \cite[Chapter 2 and
      further]{GKP}.

\item The ``product sign'' $\prod$ is analogous to the summation
      sign $\sum$, but stands for products instead of sums.
      For example,
      \begin{align*}
      \prod_{s = 5}^{10} s^s
      = 5^5 \cdot 6^6 \cdot 7^7 \cdot 8^8 \cdot 9^9 \cdot 10^{10}
      = 5^5 \cdot 6^6 \cdot \cdots \cdot 10^{10} .
      \end{align*}
      An empty product (i.e., a product of the form
      $\prod_{s \in S} a_s$ when $S$ is empty) is defined to
      be $1$.
      See \cite[Section 1.4.4]{detnotes} for the properties
      of products.

\end{itemize}

The summation sign lets us rewrite the sum
$a^{n-1} + a^{n-2} b + a^{n-3} b^2 + \cdots + a b^{n-2} + b^{n-1}$
in \eqref{eq.exe.geo-series.1} as
$\sum_{k = 1}^n a^{n-k} b^{k-1}$,
and lets us rewrite the sum
$1 a^{n-1} + 2 a^{n-2} b + 3 a^{n-3} b^2 + \cdots + \tup{n-1} a b^{n-2} + n b^{n-1}$
in \eqref{eq.exe.geo-series.2} as
$\sum_{k = 1}^n k a^{n-k} b^{k-1}$.
So the two equalities \eqref{eq.exe.geo-series.1}
and \eqref{eq.exe.geo-series.2} rewrite as
\begin{align}
\tup{a-b} \sum_{k = 1}^n a^{n-k} b^{k-1} = a^n - b^n
\label{eq.exe.geo-series.1'}
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
\tup{a-b}^2 \sum_{k = 1}^n k a^{n-k} b^{k-1}
= a^{n+1} - \tup{n+1} a b^n + n b^{n+1} ,
\label{eq.exe.geo-series.2'}
\end{align}
respectively.
It is in these forms that we will prove these equalities.

\begin{itemize}

\item \textit{Proof of \eqref{eq.exe.geo-series.1'}:}

We shall prove \eqref{eq.exe.geo-series.1'} by induction on $n$:

\textit{Induction base:}
Comparing the equalities $a^0 - b^0 = 1 - 1 = 0$ and
\begin{align*}
\tup{a-b}
\underbrace{\sum_{k = 1}^0 a^{0-k} b^{k-1}}_{=\tup{\text{empty sum}} = 0}
= \tup{a-b} 0 = 0,
\end{align*}
we obtain
\begin{align*}
\tup{a-b} \sum_{k = 1}^0 a^{0-k} b^{k-1}
= a^0 - b^0 .
\end{align*}
In other words, \eqref{eq.exe.geo-series.1'} holds for $n = 0$.
Thus the induction base is complete.

\textit{Induction step:}
Let $m \in \NN$.
Assume that \eqref{eq.exe.geo-series.1'} holds for $n = m$.
We must prove that \eqref{eq.exe.geo-series.1'} holds for $n = m+1$.

We have assumed that \eqref{eq.exe.geo-series.1'}
holds for $n = m$. In other words, we have
\begin{align}
\tup{a-b} \sum_{k = 1}^m a^{m-k} b^{k-1} = a^m - b^m .
\label{sol.geo-series.1'.pf.IH}
\end{align}
Now, splitting off the last addend of the sum
$\sum_{k = 1}^{m+1} a^{\tup{m+1}-k} b^{k-1}$, we obtain
\begin{align*}
  \sum_{k = 1}^{m+1} a^{\tup{m+1}-k} b^{k-1}
& = \sum_{k = 1}^m \underbrack{a^{\tup{m+1}-k}}{= a^{m-k+1} \\ = a a^{m-k}} b^{k-1}
      + \underbrack{a^{\tup{m+1}-\tup{m+1}}}{= a^0 = 1}
        \underbrack{b^{\tup{m+1}-1}}{= b^m} \\
        % Check the PDF to see what "\underbrack" does here.
        % I use it mainly to clarify computational steps in
        % which several things get rewritten at the same
        % time. It can also be used for additional
        % explanations.
& = \sum_{k = 1}^m a a^{m-k} b^{k-1} + b^m
  = a \sum_{k = 1}^m a^{m-k} b^{k-1} + b^m ,
\end{align*}
so that
\begin{align*}
& \tup{a-b} \sum_{k = 1}^{m+1} a^{{m+1}-k} b^{k-1} \\
& = \tup{a-b} \tup{a \sum_{k = 1}^m a^{m-k} b^{k-1} + b^m} \\
& = a \underbrack{\tup{a-b} \sum_{k = 1}^m a^{m-k} b^{k-1}}{= a^m - b^m \\ \text{(by \eqref{sol.geo-series.1'.pf.IH})}}
        % You don't need to be this detailed; I'm just showing off.
    + \tup{a-b} b^m
  = a \tup{a^m - b^m} + \tup{a-b} b^m \\
& = a a^m - a b^m + a b^m - b b^m
  = \underbrack{a a^m}{= a^{m+1}} - \underbrack{b b^m}{= b^{m+1}}
  = a^{m+1} - b^{m+1} .
\end{align*}
In other words, \eqref{eq.exe.geo-series.1'} holds for $n = m+1$.
This completes the induction step.
Thus, \eqref{eq.exe.geo-series.1'} is proven.

\item \textit{Proof of \eqref{eq.exe.geo-series.2'}:}
        % The advantage of typing solutions: You can basically
        % copy-paste the above proof of
        % \eqref{eq.exe.geo-series.1'} and make just the few
        % necessary changes.

We shall prove \eqref{eq.exe.geo-series.2'} by induction on $n$:

\textit{Induction base:}
Comparing the equalities $a^{0+1} - \tup{0+1} a b^0 + 0 b^{0+1}
= a^1 - a = a - a = 0$ and
\begin{align*}
\tup{a-b}^2
\underbrace{\sum_{k = 1}^0 k a^{0-k} b^{k-1}}_{=\tup{\text{empty sum}} = 0}
= \tup{a-b}^2 0 = 0,
\end{align*}
we obtain
\begin{align*}
\tup{a-b}^2 \sum_{k = 1}^0 k a^{0-k} b^{k-1}
= a^{0+1} - \tup{0+1} a b^0 + 0 b^{0+1} .
\end{align*}
In other words, \eqref{eq.exe.geo-series.2'} holds for $n = 0$.
Thus the induction base is complete.

\textit{Induction step:}
Let $m \in \NN$.
Assume that \eqref{eq.exe.geo-series.2'} holds for $n = m$.
We must prove that \eqref{eq.exe.geo-series.2'} holds for $n = m+1$.

We have assumed that \eqref{eq.exe.geo-series.2'}
holds for $n = m$. In other words, we have
\begin{align}
\tup{a-b}^2 \sum_{k = 1}^m k a^{m-k} b^{k-1}
= a^{m+1} - \tup{m+1} a b^m + m b^{m+1} .
\label{sol.geo-series.2'.pf.IH}
\end{align}
Now, splitting off the last addend of the sum
$\sum_{k = 1}^{m+1} k a^{\tup{m+1}-k} b^{k-1}$, we obtain
\begin{align*}
  \sum_{k = 1}^{m+1} k a^{\tup{m+1}-k} b^{k-1}
& = \sum_{k = 1}^m k \underbrack{a^{\tup{m+1}-k}}{= a^{m-k+1} \\ = a a^{m-k}} b^{k-1}
      + \tup{m+1}
        \underbrack{a^{\tup{m+1}-\tup{m+1}}}{= a^0 = 1}
        \underbrack{b^{\tup{m+1}-1}}{= b^m} \\
& = \sum_{k = 1}^m k a a^{m-k} b^{k-1} + \tup{m+1} b^m
  = a \sum_{k = 1}^m k a^{m-k} b^{k-1} + \tup{m+1} b^m ,
\end{align*}
so that
\begin{align*}
& \tup{a-b}^2 \sum_{k = 1}^{m+1} k a^{{m+1}-k} b^{k-1} \\
& = \tup{a-b}^2 \tup{a \sum_{k = 1}^m k a^{m-k} b^{k-1} + \tup{m+1} b^m} \\
& = a \underbrack{\tup{a-b}^2 \sum_{k = 1}^m k a^{m-k} b^{k-1}}{= a^{m+1} - \tup{m+1} a b^m + m b^{m+1} \\ \text{(by \eqref{sol.geo-series.2'.pf.IH})}}
    + \tup{a-b}^2 \tup{m+1} b^m \\
& = a \tup{a^{m+1} - \tup{m+1} a b^m + m b^{m+1}} + \tup{a-b}^2 \tup{m+1} b^m \\
& = \underbrack{a a^{m+1}}{= a^{m+2}}
    - \tup{m+1} \underbrack{a a}{= a^2} b^m + m a b^{m+1}
    + \underbrack{\tup{a-b}^2}{= a^2 - 2ab + b^2} \tup{m+1} b^m \\
& = a^{m+2} - \tup{m+1} a^2 b^m + m a b^{m+1}
    + \tup{a^2 - 2ab + b^2} \tup{m+1} b^m \\
& = a^{m+2} - \tup{m+1} a^2 b^m + m a b^{m+1}
    + \tup{m+1} a^2 b^m - 2 \tup{m+1} a \underbrack{b b^m}{= b^{m+1}} + \tup{m+1} \underbrack{b^2 b^m}{= b^{m+2}} \\
& = a^{m+2} + m a b^{m+1}
    - 2 \tup{m+1} a \underbrack{b b^m}{= b^{m+1}} + \tup{m+1} \underbrack{b^2 b^m}{= b^{m+2}} \\
& = a^{m+2} + \underbrack{m a b^{m+1} - 2 \tup{m+1} a b^{m+1}}{= \tup{m - 2 \tup{m+1}} a b^{m+1} \\ = - \tup{m+2} a b^{m+1} } + \tup{m+1} b^{m+2} \\
& = a^{m+2} - \tup{m+2} a b^{m+1} + \tup{m+1} b^{m+2} \\
& = a^{\tup{m+1}+1} - \tup{\tup{m+1}+1} a b^{m+1} + \tup{m+1} b^{\tup{m+1}+1} .
\end{align*}
In other words, \eqref{eq.exe.geo-series.2'} holds for $n = m+1$.
This completes the induction step.
Thus, \eqref{eq.exe.geo-series.2'} is proven.

\end{itemize}

So the exercise is solved.

\subsection{Remark}

The equality \eqref{eq.exe.geo-series.1'} can also be solved using
the telescope principle; see \cite[(18)]{detnotes} for this
argument.

\section{Exercise 2: Factorials 101}

\subsection{Problem}

Recall that the \textit{factorial} of a nonnegative integer $n$
is defined by
\begin{align*}
n! = \prod_{i=1}^n i = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \cdots \cdot n .
\end{align*}
Thus, in particular, $0! = 1$ (since we defined empty products
to be $1$); it is easy to see that
\begin{align*}
1! = 1, \qquad
2! = 2, \qquad
3! = 6, \qquad
4! = 24, \qquad
5! = 120, \qquad
6! = 720, \qquad
7! = 5040.
\end{align*}
This sequence grows very fast (see
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling%27s_approximation}{Stirling's approximation}).

Prove the following properties of factorials:

\begin{enumerate}
        % This creates a list.

\item[\textbf{(a)}]
        % "\item[\textbf{(a)}]" starts the first item of the list, and names
        % (or numbers) it by a boldfaced "(a)".
We have $n! = n \cdot \tup{n-1}!$ for each positive integer $n$.

\item[\textbf{(b)}]
For each $n \in \NN$, we have
\begin{align*}
1 \cdot 1! + 2 \cdot 2! + \cdots + n \cdot n!
= \tup{n+1}! - 1 .
\end{align*}

\item[\textbf{(c)}]
For each $n \in \NN$, we have
\begin{align*}
1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot \cdots \cdot \tup{2n-1}
= \dfrac{\tup{2n}!}{2^n n!} .
\end{align*}
(Here, the left hand side is understood to be the
product of the first $n$ odd positive integers, i.e.,
the product $\prod_{i=1}^n \tup{2i-1}$.)

\end{enumerate}
        % This ends the list.

\subsection{Solution}

\textbf{(a)} 

XXX
% This is a "proof" environment. In general
% "\begin{proof}[...]" begins a proof; the "..." is written
% in italics at the beginning of the proof.
% If you just write "\begin{proof}" without the "[...]",
% then it just says "Proof.".
XXX
% The "\end{proof}" ends the "proof" environment and automatically
% puts a black square at its end.

\section{Exercise 3: Binomial coefficients 101}

\subsection{Problem}

For any $n \in \QQ$ and $k \in \NN$, we define the
\textit{binomial coefficient} $\dbinom{n}{k}$ by
\[
\dbinom{n}{k}
= \dfrac{ n \tup{n-1} \tup{n-2} \cdots \tup{n-k+1} }{k!}
= \dfrac{ \prod_{i=0}^{k-1} \tup{n-i} }{k!} .
\]
        % I said that you can use "\begin{align*}" and
        % "\end{align*}" for a single (unlabelled) equation.
        % The "\[" and "\]" commands can be used for the same
        % purpose and are a bit easier to type.
        % (Their main disadvantage is that if you find
        % yourself wanting to add a second line, you'll have
        % to replace them by "\begin{align*}" and
        % "\end{align*}".)
We furthermore set $\dbinom{n}{k} = 0$ for all rational
$k \notin \NN$.

For example,
\begin{align*}
\dbinom{5}{3} &= \dfrac{5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3}{3!} = \dfrac{60}{6} = 10; \\
\dbinom{1}{3} &= \dfrac{1 \cdot 0 \cdot \tup{-1}}{3!} = \dfrac{0}{6} = 0; \\
\dbinom{-2}{3} &= \dfrac{\tup{-2} \cdot \tup{-3} \cdot \tup{-4}}{3!} = \dfrac{-24}{6} = -4; \\
\dbinom{1/2}{3} &= \dfrac{\tup{1/2} \cdot \tup{-1/2} \cdot \tup{-3/2}}{3!} = \dfrac{3/8}{6} = \dfrac{1}{16}.
\end{align*}

Prove the following properties of binomial coefficients:

\begin{enumerate}

\item[\textbf{(a)}]
If $n \in \NN$ and $k \in \NN$ are such that $n \geq k$,
then
\[
\dbinom{n}{k}
= \dfrac{n!}{k! \tup{n-k}!} .
\]
(This is often used as a definition of the binomial coefficients,
but only covers the case when $n, k \in \NN$ and $n \geq k$,
which makes it a lousy definition.)

\item[\textbf{(b)}]
If $n \in \NN$ and $k \in \NN$ are such that $k > n$, then
\[
\dbinom{n}{k} = 0.
\]

\item[\textbf{(c)}]
If $n \in \NN$ and $k \in \QQ$, then
\[
\dbinom{n}{k} = \dbinom{n}{n-k} .
\]
(This is known as the \textit{symmetry of binomial coefficients}.
Note that it fails if $n \notin \NN$.)

\item[\textbf{(d)}]
Any $n \in \QQ$ and $k \in \QQ$ satisfy
\[
\dbinom{-n}{k} = \tup{-1}^k \dbinom{k + n - 1}{k} .
\]
(This is one of the versions of the \textit{upper negation formula}.)

\item[\textbf{(e)}]
Any $n \in \QQ$ and $k \in \QQ$ satisfy
\[
\dbinom{n}{k} = \dbinom{n-1}{k} + \dbinom{n-1}{k-1} .
\]
(This is the \textit{recurrence of the binomial coefficients},
and is the reason why each entry of
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle}{Pascal's triangle}
is the sum of the two entries above it.)

\item[\textbf{(f)}]
Any $n \in \QQ$ and $k \in \QQ$ satisfy
\[
k \dbinom{n}{k} = n \dbinom{n-1}{k-1} .
\]

\end{enumerate}
